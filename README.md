Descriptive Analytics and Data Preprocessing on Sales & Discounts Dataset

1. Introduction
●	To perform descriptive analytics, visualize data distributions, and preprocess the dataset for further analysis.
Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns
●	Objective: To compute and analyze basic statistical measures for numerical columns in the dataset.
●	Steps:
	Load the dataset into a data analysis tool or programming environment (e.g., Python with pandas library).
	Identify numerical columns in the dataset.
	Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for these columns.
	Provide a brief interpretation of these statistics.

2. Data Visualization
●	Objective: To visualize the distribution and relationship of numerical and categorical variables in the dataset.
●	Histograms:
	Plot histograms for each numerical column.
	Analyze the distribution (e.g., skewness, presence of outliers) and provide inferences.
●	Boxplots:
	Create boxplots for numerical variables to identify outliers and the interquartile range.
	Discuss any findings, such as extreme values or unusual distributions.
●	Bar Chart Analysis for Categorical Column:
	Identify categorical columns in the dataset.
	Create bar charts to visualize the frequency or count of each category.
	Analyze the distribution of categories and provide insights.

3. Standardization of Numerical Variables
●	Objective: To scale numerical variables for uniformity, improving the dataset’s suitability for analytical models.
●	Steps:
	Explain the concept of standardization (z-score normalization).
	Standardize the numerical columns using the formula: z=x-mu/sigma
	Show before and after comparisons of the data distributions.

4. Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables
●	Objective: To transform categorical variables into a format that can be provided to ML algorithms.
●	Steps:
	Discuss the need for converting categorical data into dummy variables (one-hot encoding).
	Apply one-hot encoding to the categorical columns, creating binary (0 or 1) columns for each category.
	Display a portion of the transformed dataset.
